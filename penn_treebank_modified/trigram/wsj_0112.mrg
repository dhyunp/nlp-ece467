Congress/NNP learned/VBD during/IN the/DT Reagan/NNP administration/NN that/IN it/PRP could/MD intimidate/VB the/DT executive/JJ branch/NN by/IN uttering/DT again/RB and/CC again/RB the/DT same/JJ seven/CD words/NNS :/: ``/`` Provided/NNP ,/, that/IN no/DT funds/NNS shall/MD be/VB spent/VBN .../: ./.
''/'' This/NNP phrase/NN once/RB again/RB is/VBZ found/VBN throughout/IN the/DT many/JJ appropriations/NNS bills/NNS now/RB moving/VBG through/IN Congress/NNP ./.
It/PRP signals/VBZ Congress/NNP 's/POS attempt/NN ,/, under/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN guarding/CD the/DT public/JJ purse/NN ,/, to/TO deny/VB the/DT president/NN the/DT funding/NN necessary/JJ to/TO execute/VB certain/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ duties/NNS and/CC prerogatives/VB specified/VBN in/IN Article/NNP II/NNP of/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP ./.
This/DT species/NN of/IN congressional/JJ action/NN is/VBZ predicated/JJ on/IN an/DT interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS clause/IN that/DT is/VBZ erroneous/NNP and/CC unconstitutional/NNP ./.
The/DT appropriations/NNS clause/IN states/NNS that/IN ``/`` No/NNP Money/NNP shall/MD be/VB drawn/VBN from/IN the/DT Treasury/NNP ,/, but/CC in/IN Consequence/NNP of/IN Appropriations/NNP made/VBD by/IN Law/NNP .../: ./.
''/'' The/NNP prevailing/JJ interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT clause/NN on/IN Capitol/NNP Hill/NNP is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP gives/VBZ Congress/NNP an/DT omnipresent/JJ veto/NN over/IN every/DT conceivable/JJ action/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN through/IN the/DT ability/NN to/TO withhold/VB funding/NN ./.
This/DT interpretation/NN was/VBD officially/RB endorsed/VBD by/IN Congress/NNP in/IN 1987/CD in/IN the/DT Iran-Contra/NNP Report/NNP ./.
As/IN partisans/NN of/IN congressional/JJ power/NN understand/NN ,/, a/DT ``/`` power/NN of/IN the/DT purse/NN ''/'' so/IN broadly/DT construed/NN would/MD emasculate/VB the/DT presidency/NN and/CC swallow/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN separation/NN of/IN powers/CD ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB supported/VBN by/IN the/DT text/NN or/CC history/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP ./.
The/DT framers/NN hardly/RB discussed/VBN the/DT appropriations/NNS clause/VBP at/IN the/DT Constitutional/NNP Convention/NNP of/IN 1787/CD ,/, according/VBG to/TO Madison/NNP 's/POS notes/NNS ./.
To/TO the/DT extent/NN they/PRP did/VBD ,/, their/PRP$ concern/NN was/VBD to/TO ensure/VB fiscal/JJ accountability/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT framers/VBZ believed/VBN that/IN the/DT nation/NN needed/VBD a/DT unitary/JJ executive/NN with/IN the/DT independence/NN and/CC resources/NNS to/TO perform/VB the/DT executive/JJ functions/NNS that/IN the/DT Confederation/NNP Congress/NNP had/VBD performed/VBN poorly/RB under/IN the/DT Articles/NNP of/IN Confederation/NNP ./.
It/PRP would/MD contradict/VB that/DT objective/NN if/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS clause/IN -LRB-/OTH technically/VBZ a/DT limitation/NN on/IN legislative/JJ power/NN -RRB-/OTH could/MD be/VB read/VB as/IN placing/CD the/DT president/NN on/IN Congress/NNP 's/POS short/JJ leash/NN ,/, making/VBG the/DT executive/JJ consist/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN and/CC every/DT member/NN of/IN Congress/NNP ./.
As/IN it/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT conference/NN panel/NN now/RB deliberating/NNP ,/, the/DT appropriations/JJ bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN for/IN fiscal/JJ 1990/CD contained/CD some/DT breathtaking/JJ attempts/NNS by/IN Congress/NNP to/TO rewrite/VB the/DT Constitution/NNP under/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN protecting/VBG the/DT public/NN 's/POS money/NN ./.
During/IN the/DT coming/VBG weeks/NNS ,/, President/NNP Bush/NNP must/MD decide/VB whether/IN to/TO veto/VB the/DT bills/NNS containing/IN them/PRP --/: or/CC ,/, alternatively/NNP ,/, to/TO sign/VB these/DT bills/NNS into/IN law/NN with/IN a/DT statement/NN declaring/VBG their/PRP$ intrusions/NN on/IN executive/JJ power/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN violation/NN of/IN Article/NNP II/NNP ,/, and/CC thus/RB void/NNP and/CC severable/NNP ./.
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS legislation/NN attempts/VBZ to/TO strip/VB the/DT president/NN of/IN his/PRP$ powers/JJ to/TO make/VB certain/JJ appointments/NN as/IN provided/VBN by/IN Article/NNP II/NNP ./.
Article/NNP II/NNP places/NNS on/IN the/DT president/NN the/DT duty/NN to/TO nominate/CD ,/, ``/`` and/CC by/IN and/CC with/IN the/DT Advice/NNP and/CC Consent/NNP of/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ''/'' appoint/NNP ,/, ambassadors/NNP ,/, judges/NNS ,/, and/CC other/JJ officers/NNS of/IN the/DT U.S../NNP
It/PRP also/RB empowers/VB the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recess/DT appointments/NN ,/, without/IN Senate/NNP approval/NN :/: ``/`` The/NNP President/NNP shall/MD have/VB Power/NNP to/TO fill/VB up/IN all/DT Vacancies/NNP that/WDT may/MD happen/VB during/IN the/DT Recess/NNP of/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ,/, by/IN granting/CD Commissions/NNP which/WDT shall/MD expire/VB at/IN the/DT End/NNP of/IN their/PRP$ next/JJ Session/NNP ./.
''/'' Yet/NNP Section/NNP 605/CD of/IN the/DT appropriations/JJ bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN provides/VBZ :/: ``/`` No/NNP part/NN of/IN any/DT appropriation/NN for/IN the/DT current/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN contained/VBD in/IN this/DT or/CC any/DT other/JJ Act/NNP shall/MD be/VB paid/VBN to/TO any/DT person/NN for/IN the/DT filling/NN of/IN any/DT position/NN for/IN which/WDT he/PRP or/CC she/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN nominated/JJ after/IN the/DT Senate/NNP has/VBZ voted/VBD not/RB to/TO approve/VB the/DT nomination/NN of/IN said/VBD person/NN ./.
''/'' Thus/NNP ,/, with/IN one/CD brief/JJ passage/NN in/IN an/DT appropriations/JJ bill/NN ,/, Congress/NNP repeals/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS power/NN to/TO make/VB recess/DT appointments/NN under/IN Article/NNP II/NNP ./.
Section/NNP 605/CD also/RB imposes/VB unconstitutional/DT conditions/NNS on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO nominate/VB candidates/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ choosing/NNS ./.
The/DT language/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS rider/DT implies/VBZ that/IN any/DT nomination/JJ to/TO any/DT position/NN of/IN a/DT rejected/VBD nominee/PRP will/MD result/VB in/IN the/DT president/NN being/VBG denied/VBN funding/NN to/TO pay/VB that/DT person/NN 's/POS salary/NN ./.
The/DT president/NN could/MD probably/RB not/RB avoid/VB this/DT restriction/NN by/IN choosing/VBG people/NNS willing/JJ to/TO serve/VB without/IN pay/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT Anti-Deficiency/NNP Act/NNP prohibits/VBZ voluntary/DT service/NN to/TO the/DT government/NN ./.
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS bills/NNS also/RB contain/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/`` muzzling/NN ''/'' provisions/NNS that/RB violate/VB the/DT recommendation/JJ clause/NN in/IN Article/NNP II/NNP of/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP ./.
Muzzling/DT provisions/NNS ,/, which/WDT might/MD be/VB called/VBN ``/`` blindfold/DT laws/NNS ''/'' as/IN well/RB ,/, prevent/VB the/DT executive/JJ branch/NN from/IN even/RB looking/VBG at/IN certain/JJ policy/NN options/NNS ,/, let/VB alone/RB from/IN recommending/DT them/PRP to/TO Congress/NNP ./.
Such/JJ laws/NNS violate/VB the/DT provision/NN in/IN Article/NNP II/NNP that/DT requires/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recommendations/VBN to/TO Congress/NNP ,/, but/RB which/WDT gives/VBZ the/DT president/NN the/DT discretion/JJ to/TO select/VB the/DT subject/JJ matter/NN of/IN those/DT recommendations/NN ./.
Typically/RB ,/, these/DT laws/NNS seek/VBP to/TO prevent/VB executive/JJ branch/NN officials/NNS from/IN inquiring/NN into/IN whether/IN certain/JJ federal/JJ programs/NNS make/VBP any/DT economic/JJ sense/NN or/CC proposing/VBG more/RBR market-oriented/JJ alternatives/NNS to/TO regulations/NNS ./.
Probably/RB the/DT most/JJS egregious/JJ example/NN is/VBZ a/DT proviso/NN in/IN the/DT appropriations/JJ bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN that/IN prevents/CD the/DT president/NN 's/POS Office/NNP of/IN Management/NNP and/CC Budget/NNP from/IN subjecting/DT agricultural/JJ marketing/NN orders/NNS to/TO any/DT cost-benefit/JJ scrutiny/NN ./.
There/OTH is/VBZ something/NN inherently/NNS suspect/VBP about/IN Congress/NNP 's/VBZ prohibiting/IN the/DT executive/NN from/IN even/RB studying/VBG whether/IN public/JJ funds/NNS are/VBP being/VBG wasted/NN in/IN some/DT favored/JJ program/NN or/CC other/JJ ./.
Perhaps/RB none/NN of/IN the/DT unconstitutional/JJ conditions/NNS contained/VBD in/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bills/NNS for/IN fiscal/JJ 1990/CD better/CD illustrates/DT Congress/NNP 's/POS attempt/NN to/TO usurp/VB executive/JJ power/NN than/IN Section/NNP 609/CD of/IN the/DT executive-office/JJ bill/NN :/: ``/`` None/NNP of/IN the/DT funds/NNS made/VBD available/JJ pursuant/NN to/TO the/DT provisions/NNS of/IN this/DT Act/NNP shall/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO implement/CD ,/, administer/NNP ,/, or/CC enforce/VB any/DT regulation/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN disapproved/DT pursuant/JJ to/TO a/DT resolution/NN of/IN disapproval/DT duly/NN adopted/VBD in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT applicable/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNP ./.
''/'' This/NNP provision/NN amounts/NNS to/TO a/DT legislative/JJ veto/NN over/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS execution/NN of/IN the/DT law/NN ,/, since/IN a/DT one-house/JJ resolution/NN could/MD be/VB said/VBN to/TO be/VB ``/`` duly/DT adopted/NN ''/'' even/RB though/IN it/PRP would/MD require/VB neither/DT bicameral/JJ action/NN in/IN Congress/NNP nor/CC presentation/JJ to/TO the/DT president/NN for/IN his/PRP$ signature/NNS or/CC veto/NN ./.
The/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP 's/POS decision/NN in/IN INS/NNP v./CC Chadha/NNP held/VBN that/IN legislative/JJ vetoes/NNS are/VBP unconstitutional/JJ ./.
President/NNP Bush/NNP should/MD veto/VB appropriations/NNS acts/VBP that/RB contain/VB these/DT kinds/NNS of/IN unconstitutional/DT conditions/NNS on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO discharge/VB his/PRP$ duties/NNS and/CC exercise/VB his/PRP$ prerogatives/NNS ./.
If/IN President/NNP Bush/NNP fails/VBZ to/TO do/VB so/RB in/IN his/PRP$ first/JJ year/NN ,/, he/PRP will/MD invite/VB Congress/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT remainder/NN of/IN his/PRP$ presidency/NNS ,/, to/TO rewrite/DT Article/NNP II/NNP of/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP to/TO suit/VB its/PRP$ purposes/NNS ./.
What/WP becomes/VBZ custom/JJ in/IN the/DT Bush/NNP administration/NNP will/MD only/RB become/VB more/RBR difficult/JJ for/IN future/JJ presidents/NNS ,/, including/VBG Democrats/NNP ,/, to/TO undo/CD ./.
President/NNP Reagan/NNP learned/VBD that/DT lesson/NN ./.
By/IN 1987/CD ,/, then-Speaker/NNP Jim/NNP Wright/NNP was/VBD discussing/VBG arms/NNS control/NN in/IN Moscow/NNP with/IN Mikhail/NNP Gorbachev/NNP and/CC then/RB attempting/VBG to/TO direct/VB the/DT president/NN ,/, through/IN an/DT appropriations/NNS rider/JJ ,/, to/TO treat/VB the/DT Soviets/NNP as/RB though/IN the/DT Senate/NNP had/VBD ratified/NNP SALT/NNP II/NNP ./.
If/IN a/DT veto/NN is/VBZ unworkable/JJ because/IN it/PRP would/MD leave/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT executive/JJ branch/NN unfunded/NN ,/, the/DT president/NN could/MD sign/VB the/DT appropriations/NNS bills/NNS into/IN law/NN and/CC assert/IN a/DT power/NN of/IN excision/CD ,/, declaring/VBG the/DT rider/NN restricting/IN his/PRP$ Article/NNP II/NNP powers/VBD to/TO be/VB unconstitutional/NN and/CC severable/NNP ./.
The/DT Constitution/NNP does/VBZ not/RB expressly/RB give/VB the/DT president/NN such/JJ power/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT president/NN does/VBZ have/VB a/DT duty/NN not/RB to/TO violate/VB the/DT Constitution/NNP ./.
The/DT question/NN is/VBZ whether/IN his/PRP$ only/JJ means/NN of/IN defense/NN is/VBZ the/DT veto/NN ./.
Excision/NN of/IN appropriations/NNS riders/IN that/DT trespass/NN on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS duties/NNS and/CC prerogative/NN under/IN Article/NNP II/NNP would/MD be/VB different/JJ from/IN the/DT line-item/JJ veto/NN ./.
As/IN discussed/VBN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN controlling/VBG federal/JJ spending/NN ,/, the/DT line-item/JJ veto/NN is/VBZ characterized/JJ as/IN a/DT way/NN for/IN the/DT president/NN to/TO excise/VB perfectly/DT constitutional/JJ provisions/NNS in/IN a/DT spending/NN bill/NN that/WDT are/VBP objectionable/DT merely/RB because/IN they/PRP conflict/VBD with/IN his/PRP$ policy/NN objectives/NNS ./.
The/DT excision/NN of/IN unconstitutional/DT conditions/NNS in/IN an/DT appropriations/JJ bill/NN would/MD be/VB a/DT power/NN of/IN far/RB more/RBR limited/JJ applicability/NN ./.
One/PRP could/MD argue/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT assertion/NN of/IN a/DT item/JJ veto/NN at/IN all/DT for/IN the/DT president/NN ,/, by/IN exerting/CD a/DT power/NN of/IN excision/CD ,/, to/TO resist/VB unconstitutional/DT conditions/NNS in/IN legislation/NN that/RB violate/VB the/DT separation/NN of/IN powers/CD ./.
