The/DT art/NN of/IN change-ringing/DT is/VBZ peculiar/JJ to/TO the/DT English/NNP ,/, and/CC ,/, like/IN most/JJS English/NNP peculiarities/NN ,/, unintelligible/VBN to/TO the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

The/DT parishioners/NN of/IN St./NNP Michael/NNP and/CC All/NNP Angels/NNP stop/VB to/TO chat/VB at/IN the/DT church/JJ door/NN ,/, as/IN members/NNS here/RB always/RB have/VB ./.

Like/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT other/JJ 6,000/CD churches/CD in/IN Britain/NNP with/IN sets/NNS of/IN bells/CD ,/, St./NNP Michael/NNP once/RB had/VBD its/PRP$ own/JJ ``/`` band/NN ''/'' of/IN ringers/CD ,/, who/WP would/MD herald/VB every/DT Sunday/NNP morning/NN and/CC evening/NN service/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, only/RB one/CD local/JJ ringer/NN remains/VBZ :/: 64-year-old/CD Derek/NNP Hammond/NNP ./.
The/DT others/NNS here/RB today/RB live/VB elsewhere/RB ./.
They/PRP belong/VBP to/TO a/DT group/NN of/IN 15/CD ringers/CD --/: including/IN two/CD octogenarians/CD and/CC four/CD youngsters/CD in/IN training/NN --/: who/WP drive/VBP every/DT Sunday/NNP from/IN church/JJ to/TO church/VB in/IN a/DT sometimes-exhausting/JJ effort/NN to/TO keep/VB the/DT bells/JJ sounding/NN in/IN the/DT many/JJ belfries/NN of/IN East/NNP Anglia/NNP ./.
``/`` To/NNP ring/VB for/IN even/RB one/CD service/NN at/IN this/DT tower/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO scrape/CD ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Mr./NNP Hammond/NNP ,/, a/DT retired/VBN water-authority/DT worker/NN ./.

''/'' Mr./NNP Hammond/NNP worries/VBZ that/DT old/JJ age/NN and/CC the/DT flightiness/NN of/IN youth/NN will/MD diminish/VB the/DT ranks/NNS of/IN the/DT East/NNP Anglian/NNP group/NN that/IN keeps/CD the/DT Aslacton/NNP bells/JJ pealing/NN ./.
History/NN ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, is/VBZ not/RB on/IN his/PRP$ side/NN ./.
According/VBG to/TO a/DT nationwide/JJ survey/NN taken/VBN a/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, nearly/RB a/DT third/JJ of/IN England/NNP 's/POS church/JJ bells/NNS are/VBP no/DT longer/JJ rung/NN on/IN Sundays/NNP because/IN there/OTH is/VBZ no/DT one/NN to/TO ring/VB them/PRP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO see/VB why/WRB the/DT ancient/JJ art/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT ropes/NN ./.
The/DT less/JJR complicated/JJ version/NN of/IN playing/VBG tunes/NN on/IN bells/CD ,/, as/RB do/VB the/DT carillons/NN of/IN continental/NNP Europe/NNP ,/, is/VBZ considered/VBN by/IN the/DT English/NNP to/TO be/VB childish/JJ ,/, fit/NN only/RB for/IN foreigners/CD ./.
Change-ringing/NNP ,/, a/DT mind-boggling/RB exercise/VB the/DT English/NNP invented/VBN 380/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, requires/VBZ physical/JJ dexterity/NN --/: some/DT bells/RB weigh/VB more/RBR than/IN a/DT ton/NN --/: combined/VBN with/IN intense/JJ mental/JJ concentration/NN ./.
Proper/NNP English/NNP bells/NNP are/VBP started/VBN off/RP in/IN ``/`` rounds/NNP ,/, ''/'' from/IN the/DT highest-pitched/NNP bell/NNP to/TO the/DT lowest/NN --/: a/DT simple/JJ descending/JJ scale/NN using/VBG ,/, in/IN larger/JJR churches/NN ,/, as/IN many/JJ as/IN 12/CD bells/CD ./.
Then/RB ,/, at/IN a/DT signal/NN ,/, the/DT ringers/RB begin/VB varying/VBG the/DT order/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT bells/JJ sound/NN without/IN altering/CD the/DT steady/JJ rhythm/NN of/IN the/DT striking/JJ ./.
Each/DT variation/NN ,/, or/CC change/NN ,/, can/MD occur/VB only/RB once/RB ,/, the/DT rules/NNS state/NN ./.
Ringers/DT memorize/JJ patterns/NNS of/IN changes/NNS ,/, known/VBN as/IN ``/`` methods/NNS ,/, ''/'' which/WDT have/VBP odd-sounding/JJ names/NNS like/IN Kent/NNP Treble/NNP Bob/NNP Major/NNP or/CC Grandsire/NNP Caters/NNP ./.
A/DT series/NN of/IN 5,000/CD or/CC so/IN changes/NNS is/VBZ a/DT ``/`` peal/NN ''/'' and/CC takes/VBZ about/IN three/CD hours/NNS ./.
A/DT look/NN at/IN a/DT Thursday/NNP night/NN practice/NN at/IN St./NNP Mary/NNP Abbot/NNP church/NNP in/IN the/DT Kensington/NNP district/NN of/IN London/NNP gives/VBZ an/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT work/NN involved/VBD ./.
Ten/DT shirt-sleeved/NN ringers/RB stand/VB in/IN a/DT circle/NN ,/, one/CD foot/DT ahead/RB of/IN the/DT other/JJ in/IN a/DT prize-fighter/NN 's/POS stance/NN ,/, each/DT pulling/VBZ a/DT rope/NN that/IN disappears/NN through/IN a/DT small/JJ hole/NN in/IN the/DT high/JJ ceiling/NN of/IN the/DT ringing/NNP chamber/NNP ./.
No/DT one/NN speaks/VBZ ,/, and/CC the/DT snaking/NN of/IN the/DT ropes/NN seems/VBZ to/TO make/VB as/IN much/JJ sound/NN as/IN the/DT bells/JJ themselves/NN ,/, muffled/NN by/IN the/DT ceiling/NN ./.
Totally/RB absorbed/VBN ,/, the/DT ringers/NN stare/IN straight/JJ ahead/RB ,/, using/VBG peripheral/JJ vision/NN -LRB-/OTH they/PRP call/VBP it/PRP ``/`` rope-sight/NN ''/'' -RRB-/OTH to/TO watch/VB the/DT other/JJ ropes/NN and/CC thus/RB time/VB their/PRP$ pulls/NNS ./.
Far/RB above/IN in/IN the/DT belfry/NN ,/, the/DT huge/JJ bronze/JJ bells/NN ,/, mounted/VBD on/IN wheels/CD ,/, swing/VB madly/NN through/IN a/DT full/JJ 360/CD degrees/NNS ,/, starting/VBG and/CC ending/VBG ,/, surprisingly/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT inverted/NN ,/, or/CC mouth-up/DT position/NN ./.
Skilled/JJ ringers/TO use/VB their/PRP$ wrists/JJ to/TO advance/NNP or/CC retard/IN the/DT next/JJ swing/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN one/CD bell/NNP can/MD swap/VB places/NNS with/IN another/DT in/IN the/DT following/NN change/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT well-known/NN detective-story/IN involving/VBG church/DT bells/NN ,/, English/NNP novelist/NNP Dorothy/NNP L./NNP Sayers/NNP described/VBD ringing/VBN as/IN a/DT ``/`` passion/NNP -LCB-/OTH that/IN -RCB-/OTH finds/VBZ its/PRP$ satisfaction/NN in/IN mathematical/CD completeness/CD and/CC mechanical/JJ perfection/NN ./.
''/'' Ringers/NNP ,/, she/PRP added/VBD ,/, are/VBP ``/`` filled/NN with/IN the/DT solemn/NN intoxication/IN that/DT comes/VBZ of/IN intricate/CD ritual/CD faultlessly/CD performed/CD ./.
''/'' ``/`` Ringing/NNP does/VBZ become/VBN a/DT bit/NN of/IN an/DT obsession/NN ,/, ''/'' admits/VBZ Stephanie/NNP Pattenden/NNP ,/, master/NN of/IN the/DT band/NN at/IN St./NNP Mary/NNP Abbot/NNP and/CC one/CD of/IN England/NNP 's/POS best/JJS female/JJ ringers/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT passion/NN that/IN usually/RB stays/VB in/IN the/DT tower/NNP ,/, however/RB ./.
More/RBR often/RB than/IN not/RB ,/, ringers/RB think/VB of/IN the/DT church/NN as/IN something/NN stuck/NN on/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT belfry/NN ./.
When/WRB their/PRP$ changes/NNS are/VBP completed/VBN ,/, and/CC after/IN they/PRP have/VBP worked/VBN up/IN a/DT sweat/NN ,/, ringers/DT often/RB skip/VB off/RP to/TO the/DT local/JJ pub/NN ,/, leaving/VBG worship/NN for/IN others/NNS below/IN ./.
This/DT does/VBZ not/RB sit/VB well/RB with/IN some/DT clerics/NN ./.
With/IN membership/NN of/IN the/DT Church/NNP of/IN England/NNP steadily/NNP dwindling/NNP ,/, strong-willed/DT vicars/NNS are/VBP pressing/DT equally/RB strong-willed/NNP and/CC often/RB non-religious/VB ringers/VBN to/TO attend/VB services/NNS ./.
Two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, the/DT Rev/NNP ./IN Jeremy/NNP Hummerstone/NNP ,/, vicar/NN of/IN Great/NNP Torrington/NNP ,/, Devon/NNP ,/, got/VBD so/RB fed/VB up/RP with/IN ringers/CD who/WP did/VBD n't/RB attend/JJ service/NN he/PRP sacked/VBZ the/DT entire/JJ band/NN ;/: the/DT ringers/NN promptly/RB set/VB up/IN a/DT picket/NN line/NN in/IN protest/NN ./.
``/`` They/NNP were/VBD a/DT self-perpetuating/JJ club/NN that/IN treated/VBN the/DT tower/NNP as/IN sort/NN of/IN a/DT separate/JJ premises/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT Vicar/NNP Hummerstone/NNP says/VBZ ./.
An/DT entirely/RB new/JJ band/NN rings/NNS today/NN at/IN Great/NNP Torrington/NNP ,/, several/JJ of/IN whom/WP are/VBP members/NNS of/IN the/DT congregation/NN ./.
But/CC there/RB still/RB are/VBP n't/RB enough/RB ringers/VB to/TO ring/VB more/RBR than/IN six/CD of/IN the/DT eight/CD bells/CD ./.
At/IN St./NNP Mary/NNP 's/POS Church/NNP in/IN Ilminster/NNP ,/, Somerset/NNP ,/, the/DT bells/RB have/VB fallen/VBN silent/JJ following/VBG a/DT dust-up/NN over/IN church/CD attendance/CD ./.
The/DT vicar/NN ,/, W.D/NNP ./NNP Jones/NNP ,/, refuses/VBN to/TO talk/VB about/IN it/PRP ,/, saying/VBG it/PRP would/MD ``/`` reopen/IN the/DT wound/NN ./.
''/'' But/NNP C.J.B/NNP ./NNP Marshall/NNP ,/, vicar/NN of/IN a/DT nearby/JJ church/NN ,/, feels/VBZ the/DT fault/NN is/VBZ in/IN the/DT stairs/NN from/IN the/DT bell/NNP tower/NNP that/WDT are/VBP located/VBN next/JJ to/TO the/DT altar/NN ./.
``/`` So/NNP crunch/NNP ,/, crunch/NNP ,/, crunch/NNP ,/, bang/NNP ,/, bang/NNP ,/, bang/NNP --/: here/RB come/VB the/DT ringers/NN from/IN above/IN ,/, making/VBG a/DT very/RB obvious/JJ exit/NN while/IN the/DT congregation/NN is/VBZ at/IN prayer/CD ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./.
Vicar/NNP Marshall/NNP admits/VBZ to/TO mixed/CD feelings/CD about/IN this/DT issue/NN ,/, since/IN he/PRP is/VBZ both/DT a/DT vicar/NN and/CC an/DT active/JJ bell-ringer/NN himself/PRP ./.
``/`` The/NNP sound/NN of/IN bells/DT is/VBZ a/DT net/JJ to/TO draw/VB people/NNS into/IN the/DT church/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./.
``/`` I/NNP live/VB in/IN hopes/NNS that/IN the/DT ringers/NN themselves/PRP will/MD be/VB drawn/VBN into/IN that/DT fuller/JJ life/NN ./.
''/'' The/NNP Central/NNP Council/NNP of/IN Church/NNP Bell/NNP Ringers/NNP ,/, a/DT sort/NN of/IN parliament/NN of/IN ringing/DT groups/NNS ,/, aims/VBN to/TO improve/VB relations/NNS with/IN vicars/CD ,/, says/VBZ John/NNP C./NNP Baldwin/NNP ,/, president/NN ./.

''/'' Mr./NNP Baldwin/NNP is/VBZ also/RB attacking/VB the/DT greater/JJR problem/NN :/: lack/VBP of/IN ringers/CD ./.
One/CD survey/NN says/VBZ that/IN of/IN the/DT 100,000/CD trained/CD bellringers/CD in/IN England/NNP today/NN ,/, only/RB 40,000/VB of/IN them/PRP still/RB ring/VB ./.
Also/RB ,/, ringers/PRP do/VBP n't/RB always/RB live/VB where/WRB the/DT bells/JJ need/NN to/TO be/VB rung/CD --/: like/VB in/IN small/JJ ,/, rural/CD parishes/CD and/CC inner-city/CD churches/CD ./.
But/CC the/DT council/NN 's/POS program/NN to/TO attract/VB and/CC train/NNP ringers/NNP is/VBZ only/RB partly/RB successful/JJ ,/, says/VBZ Mr./NNP Baldwin/NNP ./.
``/`` Right/NNP now/RB ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP lucky/VBN if/IN after/IN five/CD years/NNS we/PRP keep/VB one/CD new/JJ ringer/NN out/RB of/IN 10/CD ,/, ''/'' he/PRP adds/VBZ ./.
One/CD bright/JJ sign/NN is/VBZ that/IN a/DT growing/VBG number/NN of/IN women/NNS have/VBP entered/VBN the/DT once/RB male-dominated/JJ field/NN ;/: more/JJR than/IN a/DT third/JJ of/IN the/DT ringers/JJ today/NN are/VBP women/NNS ./.

The/DT oldest/JJS bell-ringing/JJ group/NN in/IN the/DT country/NN ,/, the/DT Ancient/NNP Society/NNP of/IN College/NNP Youths/NNP ,/, founded/VBN in/IN 1637/CD ,/, remains/VBZ male-only/NNP ,/, a/DT fact/NN that/WDT 's/VBZ particularly/RB galling/VB to/TO women/NNS because/IN the/DT group/NN is/VBZ the/DT sole/JJ source/NN of/IN ringers/NN for/IN Britain/NNP 's/POS most/JJS prestigious/JJ churches/NN ,/, St./NNP Paul/NNP 's/POS Cathedral/NNP and/CC Westminster/NNP Abbey/NNP ./.
This/DT being/VBG Britain/NNP ,/, no/DT woman/NN has/VBZ filed/VBN an/DT equal-opportunity/JJ suit/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT extent/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN surfaced/IN this/DT summer/NN in/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN letters/NNS to/TO ``/`` The/NNP Ringing/NNP World/NNP ,/, ''/'' a/DT weekly/JJ newspaper/NN for/IN ringers/CD ./.
