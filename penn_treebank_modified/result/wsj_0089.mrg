Like/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT other/JJ 6,000/CD churches/NN in/IN Britain/NNP with/IN sets/NNS of/IN bells/NNP ,/, St./NNP Michael/NNP once/RB had/VBD its/PRP$ own/JJ ``/`` band/NN ''/'' of/IN ringers/NNP ,/, who/WP would/MD herald/VB every/DT Sunday/NNP morning/NN and/CC evening/NN service/NN ./.

They/PRP belong/VBP to/TO a/DT group/NN of/IN 15/CD ringers/NNS --/: including/VBG two/CD octogenarians/NNS and/CC four/CD youngsters/NN in/IN training/NN --/: who/WP drive/VBP every/DT Sunday/NNP from/IN church/NN to/TO church/VB in/IN a/DT sometimes-exhausting/JJ effort/NN to/TO keep/VB the/DT bells/JJ sounding/NN in/IN the/DT many/JJ belfries/NN of/IN East/NNP Anglia/NNP ./.
``/`` To/NNP ring/VB for/IN even/RB one/CD service/NN at/IN this/DT tower/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO scrape/VB ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Mr./NNP Hammond/NNP ,/, a/DT retired/VBN water-authority/IN worker/NN ./.

History/NN ,/, after/IN all/NNP ,/, is/VBZ not/RB on/IN his/PRP$ side/NN ./.
According/VBG to/TO a/DT nationwide/NNP survey/NN taken/VBN a/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, nearly/RB a/DT third/JJ of/IN England/NNP 's/POS church/JJ bells/NNS are/VBP no/DT longer/JJR rung/NN on/IN Sundays/NNP because/IN there/OTH is/VBZ no/DT one/CD to/TO ring/VB them/PRP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO see/VB why/WRB the/DT ancient/JJ art/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT ropes/NN ./.
The/DT less/RBR complicated/JJ version/NN of/IN playing/VBG tunes/NN on/IN bells/NNP ,/, as/RB do/VB the/DT carillons/NN of/IN continental/NNP Europe/NNP ,/, is/VBZ considered/VBN by/IN the/DT English/NNP to/TO be/VB childish/NN ,/, fit/NN only/RB for/IN foreigners/NN ./.
Change-ringing/NNP ,/, a/DT mind-boggling/MD exercise/VB the/DT English/NNP invented/NNP 380/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, requires/VBZ physical/JJ dexterity/NN --/: some/DT bells/MD weigh/VB more/RBR than/IN a/DT ton/NN --/: combined/VBN with/IN intense/JJ mental/JJ concentration/NN ./.
Proper/NNP English/NNP bells/NNS are/VBP started/VBN off/RP in/IN ``/`` rounds/NNP ,/, ''/'' from/IN the/DT highest-pitched/NNP bell/NNP to/TO the/DT lowest/NN --/: a/DT simple/JJ descending/NN scale/NN using/VBG ,/, in/IN larger/JJR churches/NN ,/, as/IN many/JJ as/IN 12/CD bells/NNS ./.
Then/RB ,/, at/IN a/DT signal/NN ,/, the/DT ringers/MD begin/VB varying/VBG the/DT order/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT bells/JJ sound/NN without/IN altering/VBG the/DT steady/JJ rhythm/NN of/IN the/DT striking/JJ ./.
Each/DT variation/NN ,/, or/CC change/NN ,/, can/MD occur/VB only/RB once/RB ,/, the/DT rules/NNS state/NN ./.
Ringers/DT memorize/JJ patterns/NNS of/IN changes/NNS ,/, known/VBN as/IN ``/`` methods/NNS ,/, ''/'' which/WDT have/VBP odd-sounding/JJ names/NNS like/IN Kent/NNP Treble/NNP Bob/NNP Major/NNP or/CC Grandsire/NNP Caters/NNP ./.
A/DT series/NN of/IN 5,000/CD or/CC so/IN changes/NNS is/VBZ a/DT ``/`` peal/NN ''/'' and/CC takes/VBZ about/IN three/CD hours/NNS ./.
A/DT look/NN at/IN a/DT Thursday/NNP night/NN practice/NN at/IN St./NNP Mary/NNP Abbot/NNP church/NNP in/IN the/DT Kensington/NNP district/NN of/IN London/NNP gives/VBZ an/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT work/NN involved/VBD ./.
Ten/DT shirt-sleeved/NN ringers/TO stand/VB in/IN a/DT circle/NN ,/, one/CD foot/, ahead/RB of/IN the/DT other/JJ in/IN a/DT prize-fighter/NN 's/POS stance/NN ,/, each/DT pulling/IN a/DT rope/NN that/IN disappears/NN through/IN a/DT small/JJ hole/NN in/IN the/DT high/JJ ceiling/NN of/IN the/DT ringing/NNP chamber/NNP ./.
No/DT one/NN speaks/VBZ ,/, and/CC the/DT snaking/NN of/IN the/DT ropes/NN seems/VBZ to/TO make/VB as/IN much/JJ sound/NN as/IN the/DT bells/NN themselves/PRP ,/, muffled/NN by/IN the/DT ceiling/NN ./.
Totally/RB absorbed/VBN ,/, the/DT ringers/NN stare/IN straight/JJ ahead/RB ,/, using/VBG peripheral/JJ vision/NN -LRB-/OTH they/PRP call/VBP it/PRP ``/`` rope-sight/NN ''/'' -RRB-/OTH to/TO watch/VB the/DT other/JJ ropes/NN and/CC thus/RB time/NN their/PRP$ pulls/NN ./.
Far/RB above/IN in/IN the/DT belfry/NN ,/, the/DT huge/JJ bronze/NN bells/NN ,/, mounted/VBD on/IN wheels/NNP ,/, swing/NN madly/NN through/IN a/DT full/JJ 360/CD degrees/NNS ,/, starting/VBG and/CC ending/VBG ,/, surprisingly/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT inverted/NN ,/, or/CC mouth-up/DT position/NN ./.
Skilled/JJ ringers/TO use/VB their/PRP$ wrists/NN to/TO advance/NN or/CC retard/IN the/DT next/JJ swing/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN one/CD bell/NNP can/MD swap/VB places/NNS with/IN another/DT in/IN the/DT following/VBG change/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT well-known/NN detective-story/IN involving/VBG church/DT bells/NN ,/, English/NNP novelist/NNP Dorothy/NNP L./NNP Sayers/NNP described/VBD ringing/VBN as/IN a/DT ``/`` passion/PRP -LCB-/OTH that/IN -RCB-/OTH finds/IN its/PRP$ satisfaction/NN in/IN mathematical/DT completeness/NN and/CC mechanical/JJ perfection/NN ./.
''/'' Ringers/NNP ,/, she/PRP added/VBD ,/, are/VBP ``/`` filled/NN with/IN the/DT solemn/NN intoxication/, that/WDT comes/VBZ of/IN intricate/DT ritual/NN faultlessly/VBZ performed/VBN ./.
''/'' ``/`` Ringing/NNP does/VBZ become/VBN a/DT bit/NN of/IN an/DT obsession/NN ,/, ''/'' admits/VBZ Stephanie/NNP Pattenden/NNP ,/, master/NN of/IN the/DT band/NN at/IN St./NNP Mary/NNP Abbot/NNP and/CC one/CD of/IN England/NNP 's/POS best/JJS female/JJ ringers/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT passion/NN that/WDT usually/RB stays/VBN in/IN the/DT tower/NNP ,/, however/RB ./.
More/RBR often/RB than/IN not/RB ,/, ringers/PRP think/VBP of/IN the/DT church/NN as/IN something/NN stuck/NN on/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT belfry/NN ./.
When/WRB their/PRP$ changes/NNS are/VBP completed/VBN ,/, and/CC after/IN they/PRP have/VBP worked/VBN up/RP a/DT sweat/NN ,/, ringers/VBD often/RB skip/VB off/RP to/TO the/DT local/JJ pub/NN ,/, leaving/VBG worship/NN for/IN others/NNS below/IN ./.
This/DT does/VBZ not/RB sit/VBD well/RB with/IN some/DT clerics/NN ./.
With/IN membership/NN of/IN the/DT Church/NNP of/IN England/NNP steadily/NNP dwindling/NNP ,/, strong-willed/'' vicars/PRP are/VBP pressing/RB equally/RB strong-willed/, and/CC often/RB non-religious/JJ ringers/NN to/TO attend/VB services/NNS ./.
Two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, the/DT Rev/NNP ./IN Jeremy/NNP Hummerstone/NNP ,/, vicar/NN of/IN Great/NNP Torrington/NNP ,/, Devon/NNP ,/, got/VBD so/RB fed/VB up/RP with/IN ringers/NNS who/WP did/VBD n't/RB attend/JJ service/NN he/PRP sacked/VBD the/DT entire/JJ band/NN ;/: the/DT ringers/NN promptly/RB set/VBN up/RP a/DT picket/NN line/NN in/IN protest/NN ./.
``/`` They/NNP were/VBD a/DT self-perpetuating/JJ club/NN that/IN treated/VBN the/DT tower/NNP as/IN sort/NN of/IN a/DT separate/JJ premises/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT Vicar/NNP Hummerstone/NNP says/VBZ ./.
An/DT entirely/RB new/JJ band/NN rings/NNS today/NN at/IN Great/NNP Torrington/NNP ,/, several/JJ of/IN whom/WP are/VBP members/NNS of/IN the/DT congregation/NN ./.
But/CC there/RB still/RB are/VBP n't/RB enough/RB ringers/VBN to/TO ring/VB more/RBR than/IN six/CD of/IN the/DT eight/CD bells/NNS ./.
At/IN St./NNP Mary/NNP 's/POS Church/NNP in/IN Ilminster/NNP ,/, Somerset/NNP ,/, the/DT bells/NNS have/VBP fallen/VBN silent/JJ following/VBG a/DT dust-up/NN over/IN church/DT attendance/NN ./.
The/DT vicar/NN ,/, W.D/NNP ./NNP Jones/NNP ,/, refuses/VBG to/TO talk/VB about/IN it/PRP ,/, saying/VBG it/PRP would/MD ``/`` reopen/IN the/DT wound/NN ./.

``/`` So/NNP crunch/RB ,/, crunch/NNP ,/, crunch/NNP ,/, bang/NNP ,/, bang/NNP ,/, bang/NNP --/: here/RB come/VB the/DT ringers/NN from/IN above/NNP ,/, making/VBG a/DT very/RB obvious/JJ exit/NN while/IN the/DT congregation/NN is/VBZ at/IN prayer/NNP ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./.
Vicar/NNP Marshall/NNP admits/VBZ to/TO mixed/VB feelings/VBN about/IN this/DT issue/NN ,/, since/IN he/PRP is/VBZ both/PDT a/DT vicar/NN and/CC an/DT active/JJ bell-ringer/NN himself/PRP ./.
``/`` The/NNP sound/NN of/IN bells/PRP is/VBZ a/DT net/JJ to/TO draw/VB people/NNS into/IN the/DT church/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./.
``/`` I/NNP live/VB in/IN hopes/NNS that/IN the/DT ringers/NN themselves/PRP will/MD be/VB drawn/VBN into/IN that/DT fuller/JJ life/NN ./.
''/'' The/NNP Central/NNP Council/NNP of/IN Church/NNP Bell/NNP Ringers/NNP ,/, a/DT sort/NN of/IN parliament/NN of/IN ringing/JJ groups/NNS ,/, aims/VBG to/TO improve/VB relations/NNS with/IN vicars/NNP ,/, says/VBZ John/NNP C./NNP Baldwin/NNP ,/, president/NN ./.

''/'' Mr./NNP Baldwin/NNP is/VBZ also/RB attacking/IN the/DT greater/JJR problem/NN :/: lack/VBP of/IN ringers/NN ./.
One/CD survey/NN says/VBZ that/IN of/IN the/DT 100,000/CD trained/VBN bellringers/NN in/IN England/NNP today/NN ,/, only/RB 40,000/VBN of/IN them/PRP still/RB ring/VBN ./.

But/CC the/DT council/NN 's/POS program/NN to/TO attract/VB and/CC train/NNP ringers/NNP is/VBZ only/RB partly/RB successful/JJ ,/, says/VBZ Mr./NNP Baldwin/NNP ./.

One/CD bright/JJ sign/NN is/VBZ that/IN a/DT growing/VBG number/NN of/IN women/NNS have/VBP entered/VBN the/DT once/RB male-dominated/JJ field/NN ;/: more/JJR than/IN a/DT third/JJ of/IN the/DT ringers/JJ today/NN are/VBP women/NNS ./.
